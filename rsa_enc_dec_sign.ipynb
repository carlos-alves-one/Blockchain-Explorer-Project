        "The code snippet is for setting up essential components from the `cryptography` library in Python, specifically for working with cryptographic keys using RSA, a widely used algorithm for public-key cryptography. The goal of this code can be broken down based on each import statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Importing the Default Backend**:\n",
        "   - `from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend`\n",
        "   - The `default_backend` function refers to the default cryptographic backend that provides cryptographic algorithm implementations. It is used in various cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, and key generation. The backend abstracts the implementation details of these cryptographic algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Importing RSA for Asymmetric Cryptography**:\n",
        "   - `from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa`\n",
        "   - This line imports the RSA module from the `cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric` package. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems widely used for secure data transmission. Importing RSA allows the generalisation of private and public keys, encrypting data with the public key, and decrypting it with the private key, among other things.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Importing Serialization Tools**:\n",
        "   - `from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialisationserialisation.`\n",
        "   - This line imports the serialisation module for serialising keys in various formats. Serialisation is converting a data structure or object into a format easily stored or transmitted (like PEM or DER formats) and then reconstructing it later. In cryptographic operations, we often need to serialise keys for storage or transmit them over a network.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this code aims to import necessary functionalities from the `cryptography` library for performing RSA-based cryptographic operations, including key generation, encryption/decryption, and key serialisation/deserialisation. This forms the foundation for implementing secure communication or data storage systems."
